<p><stong>KUALA LUMPUR</stong>: Owner of a local drawing class in GMBB shares her point of view on the growth of Malaysian artistic careers. 
</p>     
      <p>Danielle, owner of Daniellelinart, started her career here in February 2023 and it is a drawing class that emphasizes hand-made arts and drawing. 
</p>
<p>“I really love art, and I also love sharing art,” said Danielle. This is the reason that she is immersed in this and keeps enthusiastic about her artistic career. 
</p>
<p>Danielle claimed that she felt it is very important to educate more people about not just how to draw, but how to appreciate it. In her point of view, art makes people think and be open-minded as you can create your own beauty standard in art. Danielle said she wants to be part of that, to teach the people about the appreciation of art. 
</p>  
<P>However, even with strong enthusiasm towards her drawing and artistic career, Danielle shows her disappointment towards Malaysians’ point of view on art.
“Art and creativity mean nothing to Malaysians,” 
</P>
<p>She claimed that this is not just a local issue but a global concern that the appreciation of art is not that strong among the netizens. She added that Malaysia has improved over the past 20 to 30 years, but the space for improvement is still big. 
</p>
<p>While asking about her new ideas with the combination of culture and modern technology, to make creative work sustainable, Danielle said that the rise of technology makes a lot of people want to have hands-on experience. 
</p>
<P>“We are here to serve that part, because it is essential, we weren’t born just to stare at a laptop,” 
</P>
<P>She continued by saying that highlighting the benefits of art workshops goes beyond simply marketing a product and instead focuses on giving individuals lifelong skills. 
</P>
<P>“I don't really care what people think,” Danielle was open when asked if visitor comments had affected her creative process. 
</P>
<p>"The most important thing is to avoid being overly influenced by others when it comes to creative direction. Be the best version of yourself; everyone can get better,”
Although Danielle speaks for a dedicated local artist, tourists to the GMBB gallery sometimes offer another viewpoint. A visitor to the location stated that she prefers looking at art galleries over malls because they provide "new perspectives of culture and growth."  
</p>
<p>She revealed that she frequently buys local goods when she travels since she thinks it shows support for a nation's originality and culture. Unfortunately, she has some conflicting feelings about this place. 
</p>
<P>"The place is too empty," she laughed and remarked, adding that she will go back later to see the changes. 
</P>      
<p>According to her, an art gallery may also be the perfect place to hang out with family members, friends, or even lovers.  
</p>
 <P>The many ways that individuals in Malaysia interact with art spots are reflected in these diverse voices, one founded on an effort for advancement in culture and the other in unstructured requests.
</P>
