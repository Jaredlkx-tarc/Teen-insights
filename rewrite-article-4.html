<p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong>Share a laugh with your hiring manager during a job interview, it may make a good impression on him or her. You can even get a job offer.
</p>
<p>The laugh refers to a gentle laugh, instead of laughing loudly.
</p>
<p>You may have ignored that humour is a powerful tool during a job interview. A little humour can help everyone relax and break the ice.
</p>
<p>Humour can make you memorable. The hiring manager interviews a dozen job applicants and more a day. 
</p>  
<p>
They will recall the applicant who uses a joke to make them smile, instead of the one who finishes every reply with a popular term.

</p>
<p>The way to add humour includes a bit of self-mocking humour. It can show tenacity and  humility.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, humour is effective because it makes you more relatable and human. While most of the job applicants want to show they are professional and polished, which is like a robot.

</p>
<p>Besides, humour can reduce stress between you and your hiring manager. Everyone may feel uncomfortable during interviews, including the hiring managers.

</p>
<p>A chuckle can lighten the mood and create a relaxed conversation. Laughter encourages people to be more open, and the real discussion can begin.
</p>
<p>Avoid adding funny things to sensitive or serious issues. For example, political and company philosophy.

</p>
<p>Remember the humour cannot be overboard and offensive to others. The joke cannot be in bad taste.
</p>
<p>Humour can make you connect with your hiring manager and leave a remarkable impression, on the condition that you use it correctly.
