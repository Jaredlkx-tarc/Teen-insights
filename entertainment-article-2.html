      <h2>The meaning of idol to 21-year-old girl   </h2>
      <div class="meta">By <strong>SOEW WEI SIN</strong> | Friday, 15 Aug 2025 |10:17pm  MYT </div>
<P><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong> Nowadays, many youths are pursuing an idol or idol group, especially K-pop idol groups. K-pop is a type of music originating from South Korea. 
</P>
<p>Trace Yeo Tze Qing, 21-year-old girl who is pursuing a K-pop idol group, BOYNEXTDOOR. The idol group is formed by six boys. 
</p>
<P>She started to follow the idol group in 2023, which is the idol group debut. She will buy some merchandise related to them and attend their concert to support them.
</P>

  <p>The reason she likes them is because they are able to produce their own songs. From the lyrics to the rhythm, they took part to compose it. This has given her a feeling that they are talented and enthusiastic in their career. 
</p>
<p>She mentioned these vibes really hype her up and make her feel motivated as they are in the same age range with her. Every time she listens to their songs, she feels like she can achieve her dreams as well.
</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn idol to me is someone who gives me hope when my mood is low, rather than just somebody who is widely recognised. Even a little video, a smile, or a performance from them may totally shift my mood. 
</p>
<p>‚ÄúI understand that seems a little theatrical. That small moment of joy means so many, especially on difficult days, and they motivate me to keep going,‚Äù she said. </p>      
<p>Being a fan gives her a glimpse into a whole new universe. ‚ÄúFor just the reason of understanding interviews and lyrics without English subtitles, I have learnt a little bit of Thai and Korean,‚Äù she said. 
</p>
<p>She has learnt some new skills during the K-pop fan journey. For example, editing images and videos as well as the way to design and create freebies. 
</p>
<p>Being a fan also gives her a problem. ‚ÄúI often lose track of time when watching live streams or keeping up with changes, which interferes with my daily plans. Although I'm still learning how to manage it with everything else in my life, it's enjoyable and rewarding,‚Äù she said.

<p>The idol group concerts will be held in foreign countries. ‚ÄúTravelling all the way to Taiwan to see my idol in person stands out as one of my favourite moments. I remember joining the huge lines with admirers from other nations and even running across people I had previously only communicated with online. 
</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe helped each other snap pictures, shared snacks, and traded fan-made merchandise,‚Äù she said.
