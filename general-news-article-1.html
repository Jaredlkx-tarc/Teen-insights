<p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR</strong>: A recent survey of 18 to 30-year-old Malaysians indicated the number of times they use dating applications to connect with new people and whether they feel that these platforms could end up in real relationships. </p>
<p>65.7% of the respondents used dating apps before, the remainder have not. Among the respondents who used dating apps before, 60% of them claimed that they rarely open such applications, 25.7% opened the applications sometimes while 8.6% opened a few times a week. On the other hand, 5.7% answered that they open such applications daily. </p>

  <figcaption>
    <strong>Swiping Behaviour Found:</strong>Despite the widespread use of dating apps, 40% of Malaysians acknowledge they never use them. The remaining individuals continue to exhibit a love-hate relationship with online dating, alternating between infrequent, sporadic, and regular swipes.

      <p>The top reason for them to use dating apps was to meet new people and expand their social circle, while the following reasons are to find a romantic relationship and to kill time. The least common response was to have a sexual encounter. From this data, Malaysians still hold the belief that they might discover new relationships through dating applications. 
</p>
<p>16.6% of those surveyed said they had a very negative experience with dating apps, while 66.7% said they had a neutral opinion of them. The others thought well of them. Additionally, according
to the study, 25.7% of respondents thought dating apps were "not trusted" at all, and 45.7% stated they were "not really reliable." 
</p>
<p>Many respondents claimed that using dating apps to meet new people was simpler than meeting them in person, while 14.3% disagreed and 40% thought it was roughly the same. Although 5.7% got solace from dating apps and 25.7% did so sometimes, the majority stated they rarely or never used them when they were feeling down. 

<p>60% of respondents said they would be open to meeting their partner using dating apps, and the majority said society had an unbiased view of them. The most desired qualities were personality and conversation, followed by common hobbies, appearance and education. 
</p>
<p>When asked if they would use dating apps to find a potential partner in the years to come, just 22.9% would consider it, 37.1% were cautious, and 40% stated they would not. The reasons provided are lack of trust and fear of scams, followed by embarrassment.

  <figcaption>
    <strong>Yes Or No:</strong>The majority of Malaysians say that dating apps are a viable option when asked about finding love online. Perhaps romance's future is only a download away.

<p>According to the survey, young Malaysians have a conservative but open mindset. Many of them recognise dating applications as an option of connecting, but they are also aware of their dangers and boundaries.
