  Stigma on Student Mental Health: A Quick Retrospect

      <h2>Stigma on Student Mental Health: A Quick Retrospect</h2>
      <div class="meta">By <strong>LEW JIA HUI</strong> | Sunday, 17 Aug 2025 |  6:30 PM MYT</div>
<p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong> In Malaysia, conducted studies in student mental health show that university students from non-western countries held negative and stigmatizing perceptions towards those facing mental illness.
</p>
<p>Stigma of mental health refers to the negative perceptions others perceive of those facing mental health problems influenced through platforms such as media, or even through friends and family, often leading to forms of discrimination to the sufferer.
</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt help that in Malaysia, 50% of people believe that those facing mental health illness are to blame for their condition, and to add to that, 80% believe that there is no such thing as mental health problems.

<p>
With studies that show how 26% of adults face some type of mental health issue, and 1 in 4 adolescents claiming to have felt depressed, it puts into perspective the efforts carried out by institutes of today whether they are substantial enough or not.  
</p>
<p>For 17-year-old Lew Jia Jun, a student from Chinese secondary school SMJK Chong Hwa, he stated that he has come across some forms of mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety, mostly when working on schoolwork or during exams.

</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have seen school counselors and official talks about mental health, as well as surveys,‚Äù He said in an interview. 

</p>
<p>However, although these initiatives carried out were made with the intent of helping young adolescents with learning and handling mental health, influence from media such as movies and films develop negative perceptions of mental health, leading to stigma. 
</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think there is some stigma on mental health issues, some may be afraid that the counselors or other peers may make fun of them,‚Äù Jia Jun said.

</p>
<p>As for 22-year-old Bachelor's in Software Engineering student from Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology (TARUMT), Lew Jia Wei who has experienced anxiety due to societal pressure, she‚Äôs personally reached out to counselors for help.

</p> 
<p>‚ÄúI have attended one where I talked to the counselor one-to-one about some issues I‚Äôm facing, some social issues that I have had hard time finding friends.

</p>
 <p>‚ÄúI think some challenges are they might be worried about how counselors might view them or how others may perceive them, and they might also be worried about how the privacy concerns and putting their information out there and other people will know their secrets,‚Äù She added. 
</p>

<p>
Studies have shown that the fear of being judged and being an outlier comes from people thinking that having mental illnesses could bring shame to their family, with the perpetrators mostly attributed from associates, friends and family members.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think the university can have a forum for the students to help out the things they are facing among their peers, and anonymously so that they won't have to reach out to counselors in real life," Jia Wei added.
</p>      
<p>When it comes to mental health issues and the stigma surrounding it, it is an issue which needs to be addressed as students facing mental illness may very well avoid help from others due to the fact they may be afraid of what others may perceive them afterwards.

</p>
 <p>Initiatives have to be further implemented, such as what Jia Jun mentioned: ‚ÄúI think teachers could be more educated about being more wary of mental health amongst students,‚Äù allowing teachers to better address mental health issues and take action properly.
