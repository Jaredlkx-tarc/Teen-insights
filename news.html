      <h2>Young Adults Delay Marriage as Finances and Freedom Take Priority</h2>

      <p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong> For many young Malaysians, marriage is no longer the first step toward adulthood, but rather something to postpone until life becomes more stable. Financial concerns, career ambitions, and personal independence are influencing how today's youth consider marriage.</p>
      <p>One female student within the ages of 21 and 23 expressed her main fear as "financial instability, mainly due to inflation and rising living costs." Another full-time worker in the 24–26 age range simply replied, "Financial, marriage and family are expensive." Others highlighted that personal priorities come first, with some linking marriage to restriction and loss of freedom.</p>
      <img class="hero-img" src="images/online ass (3) b.png" alt="Pie chart showing pressure to marry early" />
      <p>When asked if they felt pressured by family or society to marry early, answers varied from “Not at all” to “Somewhat.” Many respondents stressed that marriage is a personal choice, best made when emotionally and financially ready.</p>
      <img class="hero-img" src="images/online ass 3 (3) c.png" alt="Bar chart showing risks of early marriage" />
      <p>Risks of marrying too early included financial instability, emotional immaturity, and lack of personal growth. However, delaying marriage too long was also seen as risky, with concerns about finding a suitable partner and potential health or fertility issues.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, many agreed that stability should come first, believing that love alone is insufficient without maturity, independence, and financial readiness.</p>
