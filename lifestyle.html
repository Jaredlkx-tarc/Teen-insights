      <h2>Young Adults Delay Marriage as Finances and Freedom Take Priority</h2>

      <p>For many young Malaysians, marriage is no longer the first step toward adulthood, but rather something to postpone until life becomes more stable. Financial concerns, career ambitions, and personal independence are influencing how today's youth consider marriage.</p>
      <p>Respondents cited reasons ranging from inflation and rising living costs to prioritising career growth and personal freedom. Some feared that marrying too early could lead to financial instability, emotional immaturity, or relationship conflicts, while others noted the risks of delaying too long, such as difficulty finding a partner or reduced fertility.</p>
      <p>Despite differing views, most agreed that stability should come first. As one respondent put it, “Focusing on career matters the most because it builds stability, skills, and future opportunities for growth.”</p>
      <p>These perspectives show that marriage today is less about meeting societal expectations and more about making the right decision at the right time.</p>
