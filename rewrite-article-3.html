  <p>In July of 2024, a Malaysian college student shared his story to sensational social media platform Reddit on the subreddit r/Bolehland, saying how he’s mocked by his peers for using an Android phone.

</p>
<p>In the post, the student who goes by the username “@Cold_Particular9128”, shared how he is being belittled by those around him and mocked just because he was using an android phone and not an Iphone.
</p>
<p>
“Yesterday someone belittled me for still using an Android in college. I’ve had this phone for 4 years now and coming, using it still before it eventually falls apart,” The student wrote.
</p>
<p>He stated how he felt a sense of “belittlement” since he had first attended college with “everyone constantly flashing their iphones" whilst he’s still an Android user, and that he’s even afraid to take his phone out in crowded spaces. 
</p>
<p>The student even recalled a moment where his peers called his phone out for “having terrible camera quality” during a stage performance recording, also remarking how he feels like he is being treated differently just because of the type of phone he is using.</p>
<p>Following what had occurred, the user shared his thoughts and felt that with financial aid money soon to come, many of his students would likely upgrade to an Apple device, leaving him possibly as the only outlier amongst his peers left with an Android.
</p>
  <P>“I honestly don't want to use the money to get another phone as I have other responsibilities. Feels like a waste just to be liked.
</P>
<p>What do you think?” He asked netizens.</p>

<p>Asking the opinion of internet netizens, his post accumulated hundreds of reactions and comments, with many users giving their own thoughts upon the matter the original poster (OP) had posted. 
</p>
<P>“Don’t care about them. Does not matter if you’re using Apple or Android. As long as it meets your purpose, that’s what counts.
</P>
<P>“Just like a MacBook and Windows laptop. Just use that fits your needs. If it’s your friends that do this, you have the wrong circle of friends,” @JackAllTrades06 said.
</P>  
<P>“You're on the right track… Bantuan money is not for upgrading phones. It's for students' actual needs when studying,” @0xJarod added.
</P>   
<P>“Bro, don’t live beyond your means just to fit in. When you start earning, buy what you want, not what society pressures you to,” @AbbreviationsRound52 wrote.
