<p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong>The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examination was once regarded as a crucial milestone for students. Today, however, an increasing number of teenagers are choosing to skip the exam altogether, raising concerns about the influence of social media on youth aspirations.

<p>Data from the Ministry of Education highlights the trend. In 2020, 62,446 of the 401,105 candidates did not receive their certificates, with 43,235 failing and 19,211 absent. The following year, the figure climbed to 70,455 out of 407,097 candidates, including 45,514 failures and 24,941 absentees.
 
</p>
<p> 
Figures reported by NST show that in 2022, 14,858 out of 388,832 students did not sit for the exam. In 2023, the number dropped slightly to 10,160 out of 383,685 candidates, and in 2024, the figure declined further to 8,076.
</p>
<p><strong>Social media’s pull</strong></p>
<p>Observers point to the growing power of social media influencers, who promote the idea that formal education is no longer essential for success. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube showcase glamorous lifestyles that make influencing appear to be an easier path to wealth and recognition.
</p>
<p>Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim, chairperson of the Parent Action Group for Education (PAGE), said the lack of proper guidance is pushing teenagers towards alternative aspirations.
</p>
<p>“These youngsters see becoming influencers as an easy way to make money without the need for school or qualifications. Some even believe they can neglect SPM because they may earn a good living as food delivery riders,” she explained.
</p>
<p> 
Although skipping SPM after attending school for 11 years is a major loss, she believes that “for individuals lacking interest, academic inclination and proper guidance, this period merely represents a phase in their life journey.”
</p>
<p><strong> TikTok dreams
</strong></p>
<p>The extent of the trend became clear in September 2023, when a doctor and guest speaker were taken aback after a hall full of Form Three students expressed their desire to become TikTokers and YouTubers.
 
</p>
 <p>“Being a TikToker isn’t a job. Those who do business on TikTok are entrepreneurs like Khairul Aming; they are not TikTokers, but rather businessmen,” the speaker told the audience.
</p> 
<p>She reminded the students that relying on content creation alone is unsustainable. “If you want to live as a full-time TikToker, your life will be unstable. One moment sales may be high, the next there may be no income for months. Influencers often face demands for free reviews, free tickets, free modelling opportunities, or free content creation. It is not a stable career.”
</p>
<p><strong>The reality behind the glamour</strong></p>
 <p>Experts warn that teenagers are drawn to the image of easy wealth, without seeing the challenges behind the scenes. “Influencers often highlight only the positive side of their lives while concealing the struggles,” one education activist noted.

<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p> 
<p>While the number of SPM absentees has declined since 2022, concerns remain about how social media continues to shape career ambitions. Educators and parents are now calling for stronger career guidance in schools to help teenagers balance their dreams with practical realities.
 
“Malaysia must prepare its youth with both digital literacy and life skills,” Noor Azimah stressed. “Education remains essential whether or not one chooses to become an influencer.”
