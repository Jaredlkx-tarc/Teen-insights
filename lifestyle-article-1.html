      <h2>Young Adults Delay Marriage as Finances and Freedom Take Priority</h2>

      <p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong> For many young Malaysians, marriage is no longer the first step toward adulthood, but rather something to postpone until life becomes more stable. Financial concerns, career ambitions, and personal independence are influencing how today's youth consider marriage.</p>

      <p>One female student within the ages of 21 and 23 expressed her main fear as "financial instability, mainly due to inflation and rising living costs." Another full-time worker in the 24–26 age range simply replied, "Financial, marriage and family are expensive." A student aged 21–23 expressed financial difficulties, including the need for savings for a house, marriage, and other expenses, while another stated a lack of education and wisdom for marriage.</p>

      <p>Others highlighted that personal priorities come first. A respondent between the ages of 21 and 23 commented, "Personal freedom, marriage is not a priority to maintain a high quality of life." One female student aged 18–20 said "focusing on career matters most because it builds stability, skills, and future opportunities for growth." A male student in his early twenties linked marriage with restriction: "Spouse will stop me from succeeding."</p>

      <p>When asked if they felt pressured by family or society to marry early, answers varied. One respondent ticked “Not at all.” Another shared: “Somewhat.” A female student explained how she handled it: “Remind myself that marriage is my choice and I can choose when or who I make that commitment that is if I want to.” Another answered, “Just know your own priorities and what’s right for you.”</p>

      <p>Some strongly dismissed the idea that early marriage is still relevant. A full-time employee responded, "No, financial instability for young adults nowadays due to high expenses." Another person said, "No, why? Why should early marriage happen?" At the same time, one response expressed the other viewpoint: "Yes, for those who want to start a new family."</p>

      <p>Risks of marrying too early were also emphasised. One young adult wrote: “Immature decisions that might cause divorce.” Another listed: “Financial instability, emotional immaturity, lack of personal growth, and a higher chance of misunderstandings or conflicts in the relationship.” A student in her teens warned of “No money no enough knowledge and wisdoms to cover the marriage life.”</p>

      <p>But delaying marriage too long also appeared as a concern. One respondent highlighted: “Difficulties in finding a suitable partner, reduced fertility or health concerns, and feelings of loneliness or social pressure.” Another wrote: “Can’t find a good spouse.” A student aged 21–23 added: “Hard to find the ideal one,” while another noted: “Age gap with their late born children.”</p>

      <p>Despite the challenges, many people believed that stability should come first. One young adult working part-time highlighted that "financial stability is the most important matter for marriage because the partners will not feel pressured to live  a better life." Another response stated, "Focus on your career because the financial climate is unstable and you must work hard to live."

      <p>Marriage is ultimately transformed, rather than abandoned. It is not an immediate occasion, but rather a personal decision based on timing, resources, and self-development. As one female student put it, "Focusing on career matters the most because it builds stability, skills, and future opportunities for growth."</p>

      <p>These responses show that young Malaysians are rethinking marriage instead of rejecting it. Many people believe that love alone is insufficient; they also value stability, maturity, and independence. Personally, I believe this is a positive transition. Taking time to mature, establish a job, and achieve financial stability before marriage may result in happier and more balanced relationships. While there are drawbacks to waiting too long, marrying too soon and without planning can be far more harmful. Finally, the responses demonstrate that marriage today is less about matching expectations and more about making the right decision at the appropriate moment.</p>
