      <h2>Commercial Cosplayer Business Grows with Hobby  </h2>
      <div class="meta">By <strong>ONG SIOK VOON</strong> | Thursday, 07 Aug 2025 |8:31 PM MYT </div>
<P><strong>KUALA LUMPUR:</strong>  For ReiiCocoa, a cosplayer for four years, cosplay is not just a hobby, but it is a source of income.
<P>The 24-year-old started her cosplay hobby with no vivid plan. She looked into Pinterest to get some cosplay ideas. She began sourcing coloured contact lenses, wigs, and costumes for the character that she wanted to cosplay.
</P>
<P>
“In the beginning, my cosplay was very rough. I didn’t know how to style wigs, and
I didn’t know how to shape them to suit my face.” ReiiCocoa said in an email interview.
</P>
<P>
However, after attending anime conventions, she found out that many people loved her costumes and the character she played. 
</P>
<P>“Because of my love for these characters, I felt even more motivated to portray them as
realistically as possible so it would feel like they truly existed in our world.”
</P>
<P>Reiicocoa stated that commercial cosplay requires an independent viewpoint, even if she does not fully consider herself a professional cosplayer. She clarified that professionals create personal brands, make paid appearances, and play a variety of roles for specific events. 
</P>
<P>“Usually, I participate in brand promotion events and sometimes receive paid cosplay opportunities to help promote their campaigns or collaboration projects, ” ReiiCocoa stated.
</P>
<P>When asked how she maintains the interest of her fans and how this impacts her earning potential, she answered that even with a small budget, she will do her best to ensure the quality of her cosplay project.
</P>
<P>“I think when you truly put lots of effort into cosplay, people can feel it,” ReiiCocoa believed.
</P>
 <P>She pointed out that with improved access to wig stylists, hairdressers, and custom-made outfits, Malaysia's cosplay culture has become more well-known and welcomed. However, she warned that it's uncommon to earn livelihoods solely through cosplay.
</P>     
<P>
“Many people think cosplayers just pose in front of a camera, but behind the scenes, it takes a huge amount of time, effort, and money,” ReiiCocoa pointed out the misunderstanding of the public towards cosplay. She added that very few people can survive on cosplay alone.
Through the process of analyzing the characters’ personalities and body language, she also learns from the stories behind each character. It helps her to understand the way they respond to different situations, and this often causes her to have valuable insights to apply to her own life.
</P> 
<p>
“Be brave and be humble. Don’t rush to be perfect. Take your time, keep learning, and enjoy the process,” ReiiCocoa said it is normal to feel insecure but do not let this take the confidence away.
</p> 
<p>In the future, she wants to hone her abilities even more so that, even for a brief instant, her depictions make the characters seem real.
